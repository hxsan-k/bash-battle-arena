# Bash Battle Arena ⚔️  

The **Bash Battle Arena** is a command-line game designed by [CoderCo](https://coderco.io/) to teach Bash scripting skills through fun, level-based challenges. Each level is a "mission" solved with a script, introducing more difficult concepts as you progress.

> [!NOTE]
> My aim was to complete the first 8 levels to reinforce the basics of file handling, loops and arguments, although the game consists of 15 levels.
