# Bash Battle Arena ⚔️  

The **Bash Battle Arena** is a command-line game designed by [CoderCo](https://coderco.io/) to teach Bash scripting skills through fun, level-based challenges.

Each level is a mission solved with a script, starting from basic solutions to more advanced scripts. Every 5th level is a **Boss Battle**, combining multiple concepts from the previous 4 levels.
